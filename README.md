workzones-optimization
======================

This repository contains code for network optimization problem, i.e. to determine the optimal workzones to be set up for a transportation network taking into consideration of all impacts incurred by stakeholders (owner, user, public, and indirectly public)

This code was developed together with master students during the time I was at the ETH Zurich.
